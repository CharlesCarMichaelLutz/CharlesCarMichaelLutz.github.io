## Summary


Charles aimed to showcase his recent projects and decided to build a portfolio website to achieve this. He kept the design simple and hosted it on GitHub Pages. Through this process, he gained valuable insights into creating responsive websites with a mobile-first approach. The portfolio effectively conveys his projects, contact information, and skillset.

The site integrates with external APIs, specifically OpenWeather and EmailJS, to display live weather updates for his hometown and facilitate easy contact, respectively. Additionally, Charles set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, which proved to be both enjoyable and tremendously helpful for updating and deploying code live.
